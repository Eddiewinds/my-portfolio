        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>  
            I build websites.  
            
            My journey into web development started in university when I was first introduced to C programming. However, the rigid curriculum left me feeling lost, and I struggled to connect with it. In 2020, I decided to face my fears and took a crash course in programming, which opened my eyes to new possibilities, though I still wasn't sure what direction to take.  
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2023, I enrolled in the ALX Software Engineering program but realized I needed hands-on competency rather than just a certificate. So, in 2024, I went back to the basics, learning with W3Schools and Dr. Angela Yu's Web Development Bootcamp, and finally found my place in building websites.  
        </p>
        <p>  
            Right now, I'm focused on developing real-world projects to build my portfolio and position myself for freelance work and employment opportunities. While I haven't worked with notable brands yet, I'm passionate about helping small businesses and organizations scale through great web experiences.  
        </p>
        <p>   
            I also have a deep interest in mentoring and teaching web development. Though I haven't started yet, it's a driving force behind my learning—I want to equip young people with skills that can lead to a meaningful career and a stable income.  
        </p> 
        <p>   
            Outside of tech, I love football and am considering starting a YouTube channel—though I'm still exploring its direction.  
        </p>
        <p>    
            For someone who has hit rock bottom, I count it all joy that the only way left to go is up.
